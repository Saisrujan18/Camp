# Camp
##Description <br>
  
  Through this project, students gain access to a common platform that allows them to collaborate on projects (or any other collaborative work) and view different club activities, as well as learn more about various experiences. The need for certain module is evident.<br>

As a way to make this project unique, we will introduce an avatar system for the users, which can be upgraded with coins they earn through their activities on the platform such as contributing. <br>

The main goal of this project is to strengthen the student community, help students share their knowledge/experience. <br>


##Profile of Users <br>

The end-users of this project are students who will be greatly benefited. Rather than wasting time in finding out what they should do in the first two years of college, they can establish a concrete plan ahead of time. <br>

##Technology Stack <br>

We plan to use the MERN stack to complete this project and may also use other technologies or frameworks as we progress.<br>
